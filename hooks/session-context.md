ui-consistency — for anything the end user will see, these join the phases of
whatever process is already running, and run the phases themselves when none is.
Use them without being asked.

- A new page or feature, or a refactor across pages:
  ui-consistency:finding-patterns → ui-consistency:planning
  → ui-consistency:implementing → ui-consistency:verifying
- A fix or a small change to existing pages — QA or review findings, a gap,
  size, colour, border: ui-consistency:adjusting → implementing → verifying.
  The check is never dropped.
- Checking code already written: verifying — after finding-patterns where no
  checklist exists yet.
- A page's design, or one to agree before building: ui-consistency:design.
- Called by the phases: ui-consistency:values, ui-consistency:conventions,
  ui-consistency:decisions.
- An accessibility standard, only when asked or required by the project:
  ui-consistency:accessibility.

If a process running this work has a spec or plan, add to it, and run
finding-patterns before its first task that changes what the user sees is handed
on, whichever process wrote it. Decide by the order the skills carry and report
what settled each decision. Ask only about a request that says two things or
leaves open what the page must show; a tie whose change reaches outside the task;
and a component the request did not name with its place, or code extracted into
one.

If the person says a page came out wrong, or fixes one by hand, offer once to
draft a report for
https://github.com/kamenkurtev/ui-consistency/issues/new?template=a_page_came_out_wrong.yml:
what was asked, what settled each decision, what came out wrong, with every
project name renamed to a neutral one. The person posts it, never you.
