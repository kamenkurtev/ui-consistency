# Does this working tree change what ships without saying so in the release
# notes — and does a release say what it releases?
#
# A pull request that changes what ships adds its line under `## Unreleased` in
# RELEASE-NOTES.md and leaves the version alone. A release moves the version
# once and turns *Unreleased* into its own `## v<version> (<date>)` section
# (scripts/bump.sh does both), and merging it tags the release.
#
# Read against `origin/main` and against the **working tree** on both sides: a
# change you have made but not yet committed is a change. It does not skip when
# HEAD is origin/main: that is every branch with nothing committed yet, which is
# exactly when the gate is run.
