# Cut a release: move the shipped version in every file that carries it, and
# turn what waited under `## Unreleased` into the new version's section.
#
# The version lives in every manifest a harness reads, and only plugin.json is
# read when a plugin updates — so the others drift with nothing to complain.
#
# Usage: scripts/bump.sh [patch|minor|major]     (patch by default)
#   patch — a fix or clearer wording; the agent does the same
#   minor — the agent does something new or different; while the version is
#           0.x, also a change that breaks something a user depends on
#   major — something a user depends on breaks, from 1.0.0 on
