# Contrast: pairs, schemes, thresholds

**Read when:** recording the colour pairings a family uses (`finding-patterns`),
or writing or checking any foreground on a surface (`implementing`,
`verifying`).

A foreground and a background can each be a correct theme entry and still be
unreadable together. Check **pairs**, never single values.

- **Resolve both sides**: the foreground, and the surface actually behind it —
  often set several levels above the element.
- Composite a semi-transparent colour over what is behind it first.
- If a side cannot be resolved, the pair is **unevaluated**: say so, never pass
  it.
- **Not only text.** Anything that carries meaning without words is a pair too: an
  icon used alone, a state colour, a disabled control, a focus ring, a border that
  is the only thing separating two surfaces.
- **Every scheme the project has.** If there is a light and a dark scheme,
  check each pair in both.
- A value chosen against one surface and inherited by the other scheme is a
  normal way to get an unreadable pair: report it.
- **The threshold is the project's where it states one** — a contrast setting in
  the theme, a linter rule, a written rule. Report it with the decision it
  settles, and carry it on the task's checklist
  ([checklist.md](../finding-patterns/checklist.md)), which goes when the task
  does.
- **If the project states none and accessibility was not asked for**, measure no
  threshold: record the pairings with their ratios and report none as failing.
- **If the project states none and accessibility was asked for**, use an
  external standard and name it as the one used, not as the project's rule:
  WCAG 2.2 AA — 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text and for non-text elements
  that carry meaning.
- That standard exempts disabled controls: record their pairs with a ratio, and
  do not report them as failing.
- Report each ratio so a person can decide.
- **Compute the ratio** with the WCAG relative-luminance formula; never estimate
  it by eye.

Record the pairings the family actually uses, in each scheme, with their ratios.
