# Conventions: the kind, the family, the proof, the counts

## Overview

Counts what the project's pages do, in the order of the work: the kind, the
family, the proof that a search can see, then the counts.

**Open a linked file, or invoke a named skill, only when a part you are carrying
out sends you to it, never before** — whatever the request that handed you this
skill says about its links. That part is not done until the file is opened or
the skill invoked.

## Which kind of page this is

Decide it first: it sets every count below it. Take the first signal that
answers:

1. **What the user said** — a kind somebody named, *a list page like the orders
   one*, outranks anything read.
2. **What the project keeps apart** — its folders, routes, file-name suffixes, a
   folder per kind.
3. **What the reference renders** — the same holders and regions in the same
   order make one kind, whatever the subject. A collection of rows and a single
   record with a submit are two.
4. **What the pages reach for** — the same holder, layout piece or shared frame.

Then:

- If a later signal disagrees, or the project does not answer:
  [rare.md](rare.md), *When the signals do not settle the kind*.
- If the trees differ below a shared outer holder: [rare.md](rare.md), *A family
  that differs by region*.
- **Name the kind in the project's own word** — folder, route, file name — never
  an invented one. If it has none, name it by what it renders, *a list with a
  form above it*, and say the name is yours.
- Say in the checklist's first line the kind, what decided it, and how many
  members of how many candidates were counted
  ([checklist.md](../finding-patterns/checklist.md)).

## The bound the family is counted in

The bound is fixed, not chosen, so two agents reading the same reference count
the same pages.

- **The application that mounts the page** — whatever routes to it or renders it
  from its entry — **and every library it uses.** Not the library the reference
  sits in, not the whole workspace.
- If the page's library is mounted by several applications, the bound is all of
  them together, and the checklist says which.
- If the page's own library, counted alone, gives a different answer — *10 of 10*
  inside it, *6 of 8* across the application — **put both numbers on the line**,
  and decide by the order on the application's.
- A library unanimous inside itself is that library's own way, never the
  project's.
- **Name the bound in the checklist's first line.** A later phase counts in it,
  or says which other bound it used and why.

## Which pages are the family

The family is the pages of the reference's kind. Take the candidates, and remove
what is not a member **before** counting:

- **What a page imports — its panels, its dialog, its hooks — is part of it**,
  not a sibling: neither end of an import edge among the candidates is a peer of
  the other.
- **A file that imports members is not a member**: a dispatcher, a route table,
  a barrel, a wrapper.
- **A candidate that renders no holder and no region of the kind is not of the
  kind.** Report it so; never count it as a member that lacks them.
- **State both numbers** — candidates considered, members counted — and what was
  left out and why.
- **If the members span more than one area** — app, library or package — **or
  are more than can be read in full**, it is a large project: follow
  [large-project.md](large-project.md) before counting.
- **If the work creates a shared piece that takes over roles the pages had** —
  where a state is kept, which side takes a default share — count those roles
  as [rare.md](rare.md), *A shared piece the work creates*, says.

*Why:* a dispatcher counted as a page once turned 8 of 8 on every role into 8 of
9 — a unanimous convention reported as one drifting page.

## Prove the search can see before trusting a count

The reference is one of the pages counted, so every search has a known answer: it
must find what the reference writes.

- **Run each search on the reference first.** One that misses the reference is
  broken, and nothing it counts is a result.
- **A zero for a role the reference writes is a broken search** — a wrong glob, a
  list never split, a pattern that misses this dialect, a bound that resolved to
  nothing. Fix it and count again; never record it.
- **A zero across the whole family is unverified**, not a convention. Record
  *none of them write this* only when the same search, over the same files,
  found something else.

*Why:* a loop run once over the whole list instead of once per file reported
*0 of 9* twelve times, holder included — the opposite of the truth.

## Counting honestly

- **Count per position** — a role where it stands — never per component alone:
  10 of 18 buttons full-width reads as no rule, and was 10 of 10 in the content
  area and 0 of 4 in toolbars.
- **Count *whether* apart from *which way*.** First how many members have the
  role at all; then, over those, which way each writes it. *None* answers
  *whether* and is never a way: *14 of 21 filter; of those 14, 10 through the
  shared toggle and 4 by hand* — not *10, 4 and 7 across three ways*.
- **Count what the component comes out as too**, and the heading level where the
  position is a heading — `ui-consistency:values`, *Elements*.
- **A count carries its file spread.** Four identical buttons in one file are
  one page's habit; 10 of 10 across 8 files is a convention. A page and the files
  only it imports count as one file of the spread; say so where a member spans
  files.
- **A missing prop is not yet a deviation.** The theme or one of the project's
  wrappers may set it already.
- **Search for the exact name.** A container whose name starts with the
  component's once turned 18 uses into 25.
- **If the task adds a position no member has** — a second control, a control
  nobody has here — count it as [rare.md](rare.md), *A position no member has*,
  says.
- **A family of one is never a convention.** Write what the page does as the
  reference's own way — never as a count, and never as what the project does —
  and say the family has no other members: [rare.md](rare.md), *A kind whose
  family has only the reference*.

## When a count is not a convention at all

*2 of 8*, written the way every other count is written, reads as a rule. It is
not one.

- **Read it off the numbers themselves** — never a threshold from outside, no
  percentage, no "most".
- **Count every way, not only the commonest**, over the members that have the
  role: *4 of 4*, *3 of 4 and one other way*, *3, 3 and 2 across three ways*. A
  plurality is not a majority.
- **There is a convention only if the commonest way outnumbers the others put
  together** — a majority. Otherwise say the family has none here, and give
  every way with its numbers.
- **Say which kind of majority it is.** One exception is written *7 of 8 except
  `<page>`*. Several different ones make a family drifting: still the majority,
  written *the commonest way, 5 of 8, against three others*.
- **The order still decides**, and nothing stalls or is asked: with no majority,
  the newest members settle it (`ui-consistency:decisions`, level 5). The line
  says *no convention here; the two newest write it this way*.
