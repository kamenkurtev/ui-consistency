# Implementing from the checklist

## Overview

Builds each page from its checklist, one page per task. The checklist is re-read
every time: across a batch, the work drifts toward the last page written instead
of the one agreed.

**Open a linked file when you reach the part that names it, never before** —
whatever the request that handed you this skill says about its links. A part you
reach without having opened its file is not done.

## One page per task, in a fresh context

- **Where the harness has subagents, one subagent per page.** It starts cold:
  the brief carries the checklist itself, the reference, and what is particular
  to the reference.
- **Where it does not, one page per turn.** Re-read the task as the plan writes
  it — wherever `ui-consistency:planning` left the plan: in the session, in a
  file outside the working copy, or in another process's plan. Never work from
  memory of it.
- Execute a task from itself, not from what the plan says around it: every task
  carries what it needs ([plan-file.md](../planning/plan-file.md)).
- If another process is executing the plan, follow its loop; the steps below are
  what each page task does inside it.

## For each page

1. **Re-read the checklist.** Every time; never from memory. Its shape is
   [checklist.md](../finding-patterns/checklist.md), and its order is the order
   you write the page in.
2. **Write the page region by region**, in the order of the tree: holders, then
   the components in each, then what each comes out as, then how each is
   written, as the counts say.
   - **Write the element the checklist records at a position** — the heading
     level included ([elements.md](../finding-patterns/elements.md)).
   - If it records none for a position, say so rather than choosing one.
3. **Use what the project reuses**: the shared component, helper or class the
   checklist names — never a new one beside it.
   - If the checklist says the project has no piece for the role, the new piece
     is a question that waits on a person, shared or kept with the page
     ([deciding.md](../finding-patterns/deciding.md), *When to ask anyway*).
   - Build it only on a yes. On a no, write the page the way the project writes
     it now.
   - Never write it privately into the page while the question is open.
4. **What the user sees happen, as the checklist says**: validation, field
   errors, when the submit is enabled, how a failure is caught and shown, loading
   and empty.
5. **Values through the theme that applies**, and only entries that exist in it
   ([theme.md](../finding-patterns/theme.md)).
   - For a file in a shared layer, only entries that exist in every theme that
     renders it.
   - Never a value read off a design, however plainly it shows one
     ([design.md](../finding-patterns/design.md)).
   - A named constant where the theme has none.
   - No literal copied from the reference.
6. **Spacing on the base the checklist names**
   ([spacing.md](../finding-patterns/spacing.md)):
   - every value a whole multiple of that base;
   - the gaps between roles as the family spaces them, owned by the side the
     checklist names;
   - the line heights it records, and the heights of controls, rows and bars as
     the family writes them.
   - A multiple the family has not written yet is allowed — say you used one.
7. **Text as the checklist records it**
   ([typography.md](../finding-patterns/typography.md)):
   - the type role the family writes at that position;
   - the whole bundle for it — size, weight, line height, letter spacing,
     typeface, case;
   - **applied the way the family applies it**: the shared entry, class or
     component, never a style written by hand beside one that exists.
8. **Colour as a pair**: every foreground on the surface actually behind it is a
   pairing the family already uses, in every scheme the project has.
   - If the checklist names a contrast threshold — the project states one, or the
     task asked for accessibility — meet it
     ([contrast.md](../accessibility/contrast.md)).
9. **The rest of what a person has to be able to read and use**, as the checklist
   records it:
   - focus shown the way the family shows it, and landing where the family puts
     it;
   - every control reachable without a mouse;
   - a field tied to its label the way the shared field does it;
   - text for what has none;
   - targets the size the family's are.
   - Against a standard only where the checklist says one applies —
     `ui-consistency:accessibility` ([SKILL.md](../accessibility/SKILL.md)).
10. **Do not copy what is particular to the reference.**
11. **Where the checklist is silent, the order settles it** —
    [deciding.md](../finding-patterns/deciding.md). Say which level settled it.
    - Do not invent, and do not stop.
    - Park a page only while a question that waits on a person is open —
      [deciding.md](../finding-patterns/deciding.md), *When to ask anyway*.
    - Put those to the user together, once, not page by page.
12. **A task's prose does not narrow its checklist.** If it says *change nothing
    else* and a line of its own checklist names a deviation, the line stands —
    unless the task names it under *Not in this task*.
13. **If the request asks for what the counts call a deviation** — "make it look
    like" the page that differs — **do what was asked**: an explicit request is
    the top of the order.
    - Report in one line what it goes against: *"as asked, like <page>; the other
      3 of 4 write the submit button full-width."*
    - Do not quietly build it the other way.
14. **Hand the page to verification** — `ui-consistency:verifying`, run by an
    agent that did not write it.
15. **Fix what it reports**, then verify again — **twice at most.**
    - List what the second check still reports as open, with the checker's
      words. Do not fix it a third time.
    - Say a report that keeps changing is a problem with the checklist or the
      checker.
16. **Mark it** in the plan: ticked for `done`, or left unticked with
    `parked — <why>` ([plan-file.md](../planning/plan-file.md)).
    - If you were handed the task without the plan, report the same status to
      whoever handed it over.

## What this does not write

No tests. Whatever process is running the work owns its tests and its logic; this
one owns what the end user sees.

## A small change without a plan

- `ui-consistency:finding-patterns` has a reduced branch for it
  ([small-change.md](../finding-patterns/small-change.md)): what is read, and
  what is deliberately skipped.
- Take the checklist for one region it produced, re-read it, and make the change.
- Before calling it done, hand the page to `ui-consistency:verifying`, run by an
  agent that did not write it. The check is not the part that gets dropped
  because the change was small.
- Its proof is one plant at the changed position, once for the change and not
  per round ([SKILL.md](../verifying/SKILL.md), *First, prove it can see*).
- Fix and check again twice at most, as in step 15.

## Then

When every page is `done` or `parked`: `ui-consistency:verifying` over the whole
set.

## Red flags

Words agents used in runs, just before getting it wrong:

| They said | What it means |
|---|---|
| "Verified by diffing each new file against" a sibling — from the agent that wrote them | The author checked its own pages. Hand them to a separate agent, or say plainly that none was available. |
| "the one legitimate mechanism shipments also reaches for" — taking a class from the page the user pointed at | Right outcome, silent reasoning. The request is the top of the order: do it, and report in one line what it goes against. |
