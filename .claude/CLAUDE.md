# CLAUDE.md

## What this is

A plugin, Claude Code first with manifests for Codex, Cursor, Copilot CLI and
Gemini CLI, that
makes a project's own design system **AI-aware, read from the code it already
has**. Before an agent writes UI, it reads how the pages are built and writes
the new one the same way: the right component written the way the other pages
write it, the project's own validation and error handling, values from the
theme, repeated code turned into components. The way of working is
**Design-Driven Development**: what the end user sees drives the code, so a page
comes out consistent and right while it is being written rather than corrected
afterwards.

**The design is read wherever it lives** — a design for the page, the theme and
its tokens, a `DESIGN.md`, or the pages already built, which is the usual case.

It is **skills and nothing else**. The only code is the session hook.

It does one thing and joins whatever else is running. Another process keeps the
plan, the tests and the logic; this one makes what the end user sees come out
like the rest, so nobody opens the page afterwards and fixes it by hand. **It
writes no tests and never starts a test suite.**

Read before proposing anything: `docs/concept.md`, then `skills/`.

## Layout

- `skills/` — five phases, `finding-patterns`, `adjusting`, `planning`,
  `implementing`, `verifying`, and five subjects: `design` and `accessibility`,
  each asked on its own or reached from a phase, and `values`, `conventions`
  and `decisions`, reached from the phases: a step that needs one names it as a
  skill to invoke, never as a link. A file of any other skill that a step reads
  is its path written out, never a link: a catalog's linter fails a skill whose
  link leaves its folder. Each is reached by its `description`, in any language.
  **A phase is a gerund with no object, a subject skill is a noun** — that is
  how the two kinds are told apart in a listing. The plugin's own name carries
  the domain, so no skill name repeats it; where a harness shows no
  namespace the description carries the whole weight, so it says in its first
  words that the work is what an end user sees.
- `USING.md` — what the plugin tells a user's agent: which skills a job takes,
  in what order, and where to report a page that came out wrong. The session
  hook says the same, and a harness with no hook
  loads this file instead — Gemini CLI through `GEMINI.md`, which includes it.
- `AGENTS.md` — the contributor guidelines for an agent working **in this
  repository**, in `superpowers`' shape; included below, and read on its own by
  harnesses that do not read this file.
- `.claude/skills/` — skills for working **on** the plugin, which an installed
  plugin never loads: `uic-writing`, how a skill or document here is written and
  what is checked after — loaded when one of those files is being changed; and
  `uic-auditing`, run by hand with `/uic-auditing`, which checks everything
  against the current guidance and proposes issues.
- `hooks/session-start` — a short bash script, run by the `SessionStart` hook
  (`hooks/hooks.json`, through `hooks/run-hook.cmd`, which finds bash on
  Windows). It prints `hooks/session-context.md`, which tells the session which
  skills a job takes and in what order, and where to report a page that came out
  wrong. It needs no Node and installs nothing.
  It has no off switch of its own: a harness disables a plugin its own way, and
  a switch in the hook could silence only the hook, never the skills.
- **Nothing is written into a project's repository.** A plan lives in the
  session, in a scratch file outside the working copy, attached to a story, or
  inside another process's plan — the three endings of `planning` — and goes
  with the work.

**Nothing may assume a hook is running.** Claude Code runs the session hook, and
has been run end to end. Cursor has a session-hook manifest that has
not been. Gemini CLI loads `USING.md` through `GEMINI.md`, not run end to end.
Codex gets the skills from its manifest and runs the session hook from
`hooks/hooks.json` once the user trusts it in `/hooks`; run end to end on the
acceptance test (#368).
Copilot CLI reads its own `plugin.json`, a legacy plugin with no `$schema`, and
gets the skills and the session hook; not run end to end.

The private `kamenkurtev/ui-consistency-archive` holds the history before this
repository's single root commit, and the old tracker. Issue numbers here point
to this repository only — both trackers start at 1.

## What the design rests on

1. **The developer's agent does the reading.** No scripts, parsers or commands
   for analysis. Every analysis program this project wrote became thousands of
   lines that kept being wrong.
2. **Roles, never names.** Skills and examples say *page holder, field, submit
   button, the shared error helper*. No framework's or library's component or
   prop name — every technology builds a page differently.
3. **Universal.** Any UI technology, including plain HTML and CSS; a single app
   or a monorepo. Structure is read from the project, never required as config.
4. **A named reference outranks a count, and a count carries its spread** — where
   the component stands, and in how many files.
5. **It decides and reports; it does not interrogate.** A written order settles
   what a count alone cannot, and every decision carries the level that settled
   it and the numbers. Three things wait on a person: the plan, shown for a yes;
   a tie in the order whose answer changes code outside the task; and a new
   component the request did not name with its place, or code extracted into
   one, asked on its own with what it touches. Other proposals and
   contradictions are reported, with the plan where there is one.
6. **Join the process that is running.** A spec or plan that a running process
   keeps is added to, not duplicated; one left by an earlier run is evidence,
   worked out again from the code. Without one, the skills run the phases
   themselves.
7. **A plan carries its check.** Every page task carries its checklist and is
   verified by an agent that did not write it, with a check proved first to
   catch a difference planted by somebody else.
   **Nothing is kept that can be worked out again**: counts belong to the task
   and go with it. Only a person's override of the order outlives one, where the
   running process records decisions; with none, it is reported and not kept.
8. **Silence is never success.** Every phase says what it read and what it could
   not.
9. **Free.** No licence checks, telemetry or paywalls.

## Working here

- A skill change comes from real work: a page built with the plugin that came
  out wrong becomes an issue. The issue closes when its pull request merges.
  Whether the change works comes from feedback the next time the plugin is
  used, and whether that becomes a new issue is decided then. There are no
  dedicated test runs.
- Designs and plans go on the issue, not into `docs/`.
- The checks cover the hook, the manifests and the skills' structure — never
  the skills' wording, which real work checks. They are bash and perl, which
  come with git; nothing to install.
  - `scripts/check-skills.sh` fails on a skill outside the platform's limits or
    over 16,000 characters, a link, written-out path or skill name that points at
    nothing, a link that leaves its skill, a link or path from another skill into
    `values`, `conventions` or `decisions`, or a library component name in the
    skills or `USING.md`.
  - `scripts/check-packaging.sh` fails on manifests that disagree, a Copilot CLI
    manifest that opts into Agent Plugins, a Codex manifest with a `hooks` entry
    or a listing field missing or over OpenAI's limits, a hook other than the
    one, or a file an install would run npm on.
  - `scripts/check-hook.sh` runs the hook as each harness does.
  - `scripts/check-private-names.sh` fails on private names (see `uic-docs.md`).
  - `scripts/test-checks.sh` plants a defect for each check and proves it fails.
- Commands:
  - `scripts/gate.sh` — everything a PR needs: the checks, the version check,
    the proof of the checks, plugin validate.
  - `scripts/bump.sh` — cuts a release, when the owner decides: patch, or
    `minor` / `major` by semver (`uic-git.md`, *Versions*). It moves the version
    in all six manifests and turns *Unreleased* into its section; merging it
    tags the release. A pull request that is not a release adds its line under
    `## Unreleased` instead.

## Rules

The contributor guidelines — what every agent working here does before a pull
request, and what is not accepted — are `AGENTS.md`, the file harnesses other
than Claude Code read. One copy, included here:

@../AGENTS.md

Detailed rules live in `.claude/rules/`, each prefixed `uic-`:

@rules/uic-docs.md
@rules/uic-git.md
